As discussed I have tested System and General Permissions for each profile. For Object wise access for each profile, I am referring to individual object stories.

For System and General Permissions, I have compared the system and general permission for each profile as provided in Confluence and noticed following issues:

*For Sales Profile*
* Manage Cases permission should be checked
* Export Reports Permission should be unchecked


*For Control User*
* ""Create and Customize Reports"" permission should be unchecked
* ""Convert Leads"" permission should be checked

Some of the above are as stated already in Dev so might be a deployment issue [~alexey.ovriakh] (Export Reports & Invite Customers to Chatter)

[~stephanie.stylianou] for the Control User Profile these general permissions require a change in the standard object permissions for the profile. Shall I continue with the above and simply update the confluence? 

The ""Convert Leads"" permission requires these standard object permissions:
Edit Tasks, Edit Leads, Edit Accounts, Create Accounts, Edit Contacts, Create Contacts. 
The ""Import Personal Contacts"" permission requires these standard object permissions:
Edit Accounts, Create Accounts, Edit Contacts, Create Contacts

Same goes for the Customer Support User Profile...
The Manage Cases permissions requires these standard object permissions:
Delete Cases, Transfer Cases","04/Jan/18 4:56 PM;stephanie.stylianou;[~katherine.bloomfield]

For Control User Profile, can you update confluence to remove the Convert Leads and Import Personal Contacts (this profile needs to be restrictive as possible)

Just stumbled across this and have a comment. having multiple field sales user roles per branch is redundant since everyone is assigned at the same level there - there would be no possible way to distinguish when someone should be in Field sales user 1 versus 2 or 3. I would say these were added for illustrative purposes by [~Jenni.Street] and only one field sales user role would be needed in each branch to ensure we maintain the reporting structure upwards to sales support and regional managers

I would like a quick and easy way to convert leads to Account, Contacts and Opportunities after the following parameters have been qualified by Tele-Sales

* Potential Tonnage
* No of Delivery Points
* Address
* Current Fuel Supplier

If they have specified that the Current Fuel Supplier is LPG then the following qualifiers would also need to be provided:
* Competitor LPG Supplier
* Contractual Status (Current contract)
* Contract end date with the competitor
* Size of cylinder they use and current price

Unless the customer Does not wish to disclose

So that i can move forward in the sales process

* Lead Validation Rules","13/Dec/17 12:24 PM;mayur.vats;[~katherine.bloomfield] [~alexey.ovriakh]
I have noticed following issues as per acceptance criteria:

1. As per criteria: Prior to lead conversion am I always required to complete the following fields: 
First Name, Last Name, Account Name, Street, Post Code, Current Fuel Supplier 
*QA Comments:* I am able to create lead without providing the First Name, Street, Post Code, Current Fuel Supplier. Other fields are mandatory fields so not left them blank during lead creation.

2. Preferred Communication Method: If they select Text, The mobile phone should become mandatory. If they select Phone they need to provide a phone number, If they select Email they need to provide an email address and if they select Post they need to provide a full address 
*QA Comment:* - QA Verified. Validation working as expected.

3.  If the Current Fuel Supplier is set to LPG Rollover am I required to complete the following fields before converting the lead: - Potential Tonnage, No of Delivery Points, Competitor LPG Supplier, Contractual Status (Current contract), Competitor Contract End Date, Size of cylinder they use, Current price 
*QA Comment:* For Current Fuel Supply as LPG, I got a validation message: ""Validation error on Lead: If Current Supplier = LPG please complete all fields in the section labelled Competitor Information."". But, few fields mentioned in the acceptance criteria are not part of the labelled section such as Potential Tonnage, Number of Delivery Points and I am able to convert lead even if I am not filling all the fields provided in the acceptance criteria.

4. 3. Is the validation bypassed for LPG Rollover if the Customer does not wish to disclose flag is set to True? 
*QA Comment:* This validation is failing right now and I am not able to convert lead when Current Fuel Supply = LPG and ""Does Not Wish To Disclose"" is set to True with validation message for supplier=LPG. Ideally, since the checkbox is checked this validation rule should have been bypassed.

5. If I try to convert a lead that does not have one or more of the qualifiers, does the system prevent me from doing so? 
*QA Comment:* QA Verified.

6. If I complete the qualifiers, does the system allow me to convert the lead? 
*QA Comment:* QA Verified. If all validations are met, User is able to convert lead successfully.

7. Is the information mapped to the respective records?
*QA Comment:*  QA Verified

8. Can I edit the subsequent converted records and progress with the sales process? 
*QA Comment:* QA Verified.

* As per story description: ""As a sales user I would like to view assets such as cylinders and cages against accounts so I can see what assets are against our customers so that we can track our assets"", 
*QA Point:* But right now user cannot view assets associated with an account record. There is no related list which shows asset associated with the account record.

*Page Layout Issues*
* Asset Owner field is not added to Asset Page layout.
* ""Deficiency/ Surplus"" field should be Read Only


Also, I have a doubt regarding one of the acceptance criteria which says: ""Can a user view Parent of the Asset, remove the parent or reparent the asset"". [Point 8,9,10 of acceptance criteria for Sales Profile User]
*QA Point:* Since Account is a mandatory field on Asset Object so the user cannot remove the Parent of the Asset. Is this correct?","04/Jan/18 2:36 PM;stephanie.stylianou;[~mayur.vats] 
On your final point, technically this is feasible by assigning a parent contact instead of an account. For the purposes of this implementation, that use case is redundant so we should only investigate the re-parenting use case.

I believe that the intended OBTC status codes are as follows so we can add these as the picklist until phase 2:

* Order Confirmed
* Processing
* Dispatched
{color:red}* En Route
* Calor has Arrived{color}

* Message cannot be dynamic (i.e. retrieve contract dates) with configuration. This would require development time. Please confirm whether this is the MUST requirement
* If we are going with standard configuration, how will the message be removed? We need some kind of acknowledgment flag. Please provide wording
* The amendment process can be delivered with out of the box CPQ. However, we need to consider integration implications around contractual amendments as I am not sure those scenarios were captured as part of the onboarding process. 
* Use case between National and other needs to be more clearly defined. 
* User story mentions amendments and renegotiation  but acceptance criteria only points to amendments.

I think that is covered by them not being able to edit the read only fields?,"05/Jan/18 4:45 PM;stephanie.stylianou;[~Jenni.Street]: ok thank you for clarifying. The issue we are facing is around the Active field. We are unable to change the field level security of the standard field, i.e. it is editable for everyone with edit access to the product object. If this is an issue we could create different page views for the profiles to simply hide the field. Please let me know of your thoughts on this

",09/Jan/18 4:34 PM;Jenni.Street;[~stephanie.stylianou] it's more that we would not want non-system administrators being able to mark products as no longer active in the CRM system as we should keep a central control over our product offering and it would be quite a high risk if everyone had access to mark a product as not active.  Our understanding is that we would control this by a system administrator as otherwise a sales person for example could accidentally select a product as not active and remove it from everyone's offerings.,"10/Jan/18 12:22 AM;stephanie.stylianou;[~Jenni.Street]ok, we will expose two different pages to ensure this is controlled","24/Jan/18 10:24 AM;stephanie.stylianou;[~Jenni.Street]: 

Acceptance criteria is wrong in this story. 

Based on the fact the products are an integration object, it should be that:

* System admins can Create, Read, Edit and Delete
* Control User, Customer Support and Sales User should be able to Read and Edit (Product Name field only)

The reason is we don't want users to be able to create products as these would not exist in E1 and could lead to integration issues. remember products are mastered in E1

Please update the criteria as soon as possible as this is blocking testing and a bug was raised for contradictory requirements.

Also have we got a story for distance selling regs 'cooling off periods' for B2C customers?","12/Dec/17 2:15 PM;stephanie.stylianou;[~Jane.McCluskey]

There's a couple of things to consider based on your comments:
* You are implying we need two different processes for B2B and B2C from lead to oppty creation, is that the case?
* How would this work for self generated leads? Credit checking cannot be completed from the tablet. would this be an optional thing?
* How do we consider capturing the credit check outcomes to suggest payment terms?
* we have a user story around the cancellation period, not sure what you mean by distance selling

Copying [~Jenni.Street] in for reference. We need a decision on this process as soon as we can as credit checking has an impact on the contract approval process, and the trigger criteria on CG-307 (we assume its on credit control approval not contract signature)","12/Dec/17 3:08 PM;Jane.McCluskey;Credit checking - if lead is qualified via the qualification team then credit checking may be part of this so that when lead is downloaded to mobile, salesman can see recommendations.

For self gen leads entered into the mobile by the sales user no requirement to credit check.
There is a credit limit field in E1, currently not used, that we may choose to use in future and pull through onto the mobile app - for service only.
Distance selling regs apply to over the phone sales, but is referred to by Jenni above as cooling off period CG-200.

As discussed a few days back on Slack, Adding version number on the splash screen is a bit difficult as we are not storing it as plain text. We are getting it dynamically from Salesforce within the sync data itself so doesn't make sense to display it on splash. The splash screen disappears as soon as sync is finished.

As a suggestion, Can we add this version number somewhere else? We get this version number on settings page provided by Mobile Caddy out of the box. Is it sufficient?

Please share your thoughts on this.

This user story is linked to another 2 user stories in the following way:

CG-281 Looks at the initial assignment once a lead has been converted
CG-60 Looks at re-assigning when the postcode districts have been reshuffled
CG-184 Looks at delegated assignment for long holidays

Please look at the confluence article for more details into what we are sugesting. 

High level, the logic will be looking at doing the following:
The logic recently received is :
For Customers
If the Account is a National Network Account then Segment based assignment for Network National sales people
If the Account is a Non National Network Account then Billing postcode based assignment
If the Account is a National Account then Segment based assignment for National sales people
If the Account is a Non National Account then Segment and Postcode based assignment
For Delivery points:
If the Delivery Point's parent is a National Network Account then Postcode based assignment to a Non National Network sales person (i.e. expect a different owner than parent)
If the Delivery Point's parent Account is a Non National Network Account then postcode based assignment (i.e. expect the same owner as parent unless delivery point location different) 
If the Delivery Point's parent is a National Account then Postcode based assignment to a Non National Account sales person (i.e. expect a different owner than parent)
If the Delivery Point's parent is a Non National Account then Segment and Postcode based assignment (i.e. expect the same owner as parent unless delivery point location different) 
Opportunities should be assigned to same sales person as the parent account record.

She approves of the process change around triggering off of an opportunity win with the provision that we ensure that from a calor reporting perspective we don't call it a win until the contract is signed. We also had a brief chat about who should action the task to post out the contract - she thinks it will need it to be done by a sales support function but we're not sure  how we can translate a Salesforce task into a WiRe request or similar ....

Note: Sales support will not be using salesforce as part of Phase 1. We could send an email notification out to a group sales support email ? Phase 2 sales support can use cases for this and routing rules around case management

A question on the Estimated Tonnage Forecast:
Salesforce only allows custom forecasting on currency fields but Estimated Tonnage is a number on opportunity

We have a couple of options:
# Not forecast on Estimated Tonnage
# Push the Estimated Tonnage into a hidden currency field so it shows up on Forecasting (unfortunately, with a currency symbol). Again multiple options here:
*  we can do it like for like : i.e. the Estimated Tonnage Number on Opportunity= the forecasting field in Currency
*  Do some Maths in the background to give you a more meaningful currency figure: i.e. Estimated Tonnage Number on Opportunity = the forecasting field * a gas price
* Do some maths on the product so that we use the quantity of each product times the gas against the cylinder times the price against the cylinder

How would you like to proceed with this?

2. For Sales User, AC Point 2C: There is no opportunity stage as 'Contract Sent'.
3. For Sales User, AC Point 2D: Opportunity stage 'Closed Won - Contract Pending' should also be added under Closed Forecast Category.
4. For Admin User, AC point 2: Based on comments,Forecast types to be delivered are :

Some AC updates are required to pass this user story. Estimated Tonnage will need to be removed from AC Point 1 as agreed on above comments. 

AC Point 2C for: Commit Forecast Category: Contract Sent , Contract Sent is no longer an Opportunity Stage so the Commit Forecast category is redundant. This will need to be removed from AC.

AC Point 2D: I will update to include Closed Won - Contract Pending as well as Closed Won - Contract Active

And the forecast types have been updated to: 

2. Are the following Forecast Types available:

The document you are sending complies to the RFC 5234 whilst salesforce complies to RFC 2822 out of the box. 

The only differences between the two versions are the following as per: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#appendix-B 

The following are changes from [RFC2822].
   1.   Assorted typographical/grammatical errors fixed and clarifications made.
   2.   Changed ""standard"" to ""document"" or ""specification"" throughout.
   3.   Made distinction between ""header field"" and ""header section"".
   4.   Removed NO-WS-CTL from ctext, qtext, dtext, and unstructured.*
   5.   Moved discussion of specials to the ""Atom"" section.  Moved text  to ""Overall message syntax"" section.
   6.   Simplified CFWS syntax.
   7.   Fixed unstructured syntax.
   8.   Changed date and time syntax to deal with white space in
        obsolete date syntax.
   9.   Removed quoted-pair from domain literals and message
        identifiers.*
   10.  Clarified that other specifications limit domain syntax.
   11.  Simplified ""Bcc:"" and ""Resent-Bcc:"" syntax.
   12.  Allowed optional-field to appear within trace information.
   13.  Removed no-fold-quote from msg-id.  Clarified syntax
        limitations.
   14.  Generalized ""Received:"" syntax to fix bugs and move definition
        out of this document.
   15.  Simplified obs-qp.  Fixed and simplified obs-utext (which now
        only appears in the obsolete syntax).  Removed obs-text and obs-
        char, adding obs-body.
   16.  Fixed obsolete date syntax to allow for more (or less) comments
        and white space.
   17.  Fixed all obsolete list syntax (obs-domain-list, obs-mbox-list,
        obs-addr-list, obs-phrase-list, and the newly added obs-group-
        list).
   18.  Fixed obs-reply-to syntax.
   19.  Fixed obs-bcc and obs-resent-bcc to allow empty lists.
   20.  Removed obs-path.

I have made some assumptions below and just need to confirm with yourself and Steph. 


{color:red}Due Date = TODAY() {color}- this means the Due Date of the task will be the day of when the contract was approved. 

{color:red}Assigned to ID = Contract Owner{color} - [~stephanie.stylianou] as mentioned this will be a delegated customer support agent in the future but don't think this has been built out yet. 

{color:red}Priority = High{color} - Just a priority level of the task to be completed. I made the assumption of High. 

{color:red}Status = Open{color}

{color:red}Subject = Send Customer Welcome Pack{color} - this can be anything, let me know what you wish the subject of the task to state, normally it refers in short the action needed. 

{color:red}Related To = Contracts{color} [~stephanie.stylianou] should we relate the task to the contract level or account level for example? 

Once the above is confirmed, I will update the acceptance criteria accordingly. This will help the QA team when they come to test/validate. 








","17/Jan/18 2:47 PM;Jenni.Street;[~jack.holliday]  Yes agree with all the above.

We cannot dynamically attach the signed documents to emails using configuration. There are 3 journeys to distribute contracts: 

Journey 1 - Contract signed via email: Docusign will send them the completed version of the document as part of the OOB functionality. Would it be required for a resend in this case? Should we send them a different email with the reference?
Journey 2 - Signed by post: They should have a hard copy. Same question as above
Journey 3 - In person: We could amend our generation logic to also send the contract to the customer at that stage

I have spoken to SF Support and they have advised to create a custom Duplicate and Matching rule for Account.

I have made the changes necessary so this can be tested again in Discovery.

*During the call they investigated why we cannot view the custom Duplicate error message on the account creation- they have advised that this is a limitation of the account duplicate rule functionality - the error message will show ""Use one of these records instead?"" instead of the custom message that has been set on the account duplicate rule.*

This should now satisfy AC #4 & #5. 

Components to Deploy: [~jack.holliday]

Matching Rules:
Match Account Address and Website
Match Account and Phone
Match Account Website and Phone

Duplicate Rules:

Duplicate Account Address and Website
Duplicate Account and Phone
Duplicate Account Website and Phone 

[~Jenni.Street] Priya has raised a bug relating to the acceptance criteria point 7. The custom Alert message - *""An account already exists with this name, did you intend to create a new on or can you use the existing one?""*, though having been set, does not always appear on the alert. After a troubleshooting call with Salesforce Support they confirmed that the standard duplicate functionality is working as it should and that the custom message appears intermittently. This will now contradict the acceptance criteria as the system cannot guarantee this message will always show up on duplicate creation.

The standard SF duplicate message reads:

""The record you're about to create looks like a duplicate. Open an existing record instead? *View Details*""

After the user clicks *View Details* they are prompted with a message:

""Use this record?”… followed by thumbnails of potential duplicate record to select from or choose to cancel the window and create the record anyway.

Would you agree to amending the acceptance criteria #7  to use the standard duplicate message rather than the custom message?

1. As per description, First Validation is failing. I am able to associate Account other than Group/Customer Type Accounts as parent accounts for Customer Accounts. [For e.g. I am able to associate Delivery Type Account as Parent of Customer Type Account which is not expected]

2. For Second Validation, I am able to associate only customer type account as the parent on Delivery Account but this validation works even when Parent Account is Blank. So, due to this validation, I am not able to create a new account of type Delivery if Parent Account is not provided. Is this expected? Story CG-131 does not say that Parent field needs to be mandatory for Delivery Type Accounts

Feedback on your comments
* For Account look up field, Expected label: ""Account"" but Label on the page is: ""Name"" : The change was requested by Calor, to rename the Account Name field on the Account object to Name only to avoid confusion when creating Customer, Delivery points and Group Accounts. this had a knock on effect on the Opportunity Account Name field and other labels. [~katherine.bloomfield] can you pick this up with the BAs please and explain the issue - see what the preference is?
* CampaignId field not added to page layout - agreed this is an omission. 
* Label for opportunity Name field is not correct - agreed but this would have a dependency with point 1. cc [~katherine.bloomfield]

","10/Jan/18 11:12 AM;jack.holliday;[~Jenni.Street] Hi Jennie, there was a request by Calor to rename the  ""Account Name"" field on the Account object to ""Name"" only to avoid confusion when creating Customer, Delivery points and Group Accounts. 

However, this has caused the naming convention to be used on the Opportunity level too.
For example, the Opportunity detail would say Name = XYZ. However this could cause some confusion not knowing that this is the Account Name.  I think for best practice it should be ""Account Name"" but let me know your preference.

Please have a look:

1. Name label is not changed to Account Name.
2. CampaignId field not added to page layout
3. Extra value (""*Calor Staff*"") in Lead source pick list.
4. Label for opportunity Name field is not correct.
5. KEY FIELDS:
5.1. Field Label of ”Contractural Status” is not correct. It should be “Contractual Status (Current contract)”. 
5.2. As per confluence document, Label of “Current Cylinder Size 1” should be “Size of cylinder they use”

[~danyial.gilani] You have renamed ""Current Cylinder Size 1"" to ""Current Product 1"" on the Lead Object. I'm assuming this was from a requirement you have received? Should this be reflected on the Opportunity Object as well because the fields are automatically pulled across upon Lead Conversion.

If you look at the screen shot we have Current Price 1 and Current Cylinder Size 1 under the ""Value Proposition"" stage.

Contract non-owner is allowed to progress the contract through the sales process lifecycle. Ideally, non-owner should not be able to change stage of the contract record.

*Field-Related Issues:*

* ""Contract Number"" should be in the format: ""CN-000000"". Right now it is in the format: ""00000101""
* ""Payment Terms"" picklist field does not exist on Contract Object.
* ""Is Extended Credit Required?"" field does not exist on Contract Object
* ""Status"" picklist to include ""Terminated"" and ""Expired"" as picklist values later. [Note for later, not an issue]
* ""Order"" field is visible only to System Administrator profile user and hidden from other profile users which is not as expected
* ""Owner ID"" field should have History Tracking Enabled which will allow us to track if ownership of contract is changed.


*Page Layout Issues:*

Retested above points and below are the observations:
1. There is a confusion regarding 'Status' field on Contract page layout that on confluence, Status and status category is mentioned under Status type as shown below however on page layout there are 7 values available in status picklist(shown below).
 !Confluence Status.png|thumbnail!  !Status on Contract Page Layout.png|thumbnail! 

2. Contract Number is available on the page layout however issue is with the 
format as described in the Bug description.
3. Access Issues: 
Contract non-owner is allowed to progress the contract through the sales process lifecycle. Ideally, non-owner should not be able to change stage of the contract record.

Second point, I will pick up with [~alexey.ovriakh] to me it seems like a manual step missed in deployment. 

Third point, a validation rule is awaiting to be deployed to meet this called: Contract_Owner_Update_Status and is part of CG-820 [~alexey.ovriakh] let me Yogesh know when this has been deployed. ","13/Feb/18 10:30 AM;jack.holliday;[~jayna.halai] to update the contract status in discovery (QA)

cc [~mayur.vats] [~jayna.halai] ","12/Apr/18 4:43 PM;mayur.vats;[~Jenni.Street] As per our discussion, We will have 4 different versions of agreements for contracts sent via Docusign

1. Unsigned Version : This will initial version of the document which is not signed by any party.
2. Signed by Customer: This version of agreement will have customer signatures.
3. Signed by both Customer & Calor team: This version of agreement will have customer & calor team person's signatures.
4. Expired version: Expired version of agreement

Can you please confirm above points. ","13/Apr/18 11:07 AM;jack.holliday;[~mayur.vats]  & [~kunal.narula] & [~Jenni.Street]


There are two solutions for this:

1. Unsigned version - This will initial version of the document which is not signed by any party.
2. Signed by both Customer & Calor team - This version of agreement will have customer & calor team person's signatures.
3. Expired version: Expired version of agreement


OR 

1. Unsigned version - This will initial version of the document which is not signed by any party.
2. Signed by both Customer  1 - This version of agreement will have customer 1 signature
3. Signed by both Customer  2 (if applicable) - This version of agreement will have customer 1 & 2 signature 
4. Signed by both Customer & Calor team: This version of agreement will have customer & calor team person's signatures.
5. Expired version: Expired version of agreement

@Qualitest team [~Les.Mason] [~onkar.dhanjal] Points to consider while testing the expired version:
1. Change the Docusign envelope  expiry setting to 1 day. 
2. Please make sure no new deployments are carried out while testing this scenario as new deployments reset the setting back to 30 days.

Please find the issues related to CG-32.

1. I was able to create lead without providing the *Street, Post Code, Current Fuel Supplier*. These fields should be mandatory.

2. I am getting this error: 
_First Name needs to start with a capital letter and contain more than one character. _
Please refer to the attached screenshot.

3. Assuming one of the value of pick list - Current Fuel Supplier has been changed from LPG Rollover to LPG. Please confirm!

4. Few fields mentioned in the acceptance criteria are not part of the _Competitor Information_ section such as *Potential Tonnage, Number of Delivery Points.*

5. Is the validation bypassed for LPG Rollover if the Customer does not wish to disclose flag is set to True?  — this scenario is failing.

1. You should be able to create a lead, you should not be able to Convert a lead without the fields being completed
2. This is user story CG-322 which passed testing
3. Yes value is now LPG
4. That is because they do not apply just people with LPG . They are lead info that should be known to the prospect if they are already to with an LPG competitor hence easy to complete. 
5. The validation should be bypassed when Current Fuel Supply = LPG and ""Does Not Wish To Disclose"" is set to True. I'll check this and come back
6. Which app are you using?
","10/Jan/18 3:32 PM;kunal.narula;Hi [~stephanie.stylianou]
Please find my comments for 4th point.
When user has completed all the fields in the Competitor Information section. System throws a generalised error:
*If Current Supplier = LPG please complete all fields in the section labelled Competitor Information.*

The error is because *Potential Tonnage and Number of Delivery Points* are not present in the competitor section and user never understands why the error is not going away even after providing values to all fields of Competitor Information section.

Happy to demo this scenario on call.",10/Jan/18 3:50 PM;stephanie.stylianou;Ah ok I understand. Ok I will change the message,"15/Jan/18 3:26 PM;kunal.narula;Hello [~stephanie.stylianou],

This bug is failing in the retesting. Please find my comments as below:

*1st* point is failing. Sales user is able to *convert* a lead without completing the following fields:
- Street 
- Post Code 
- Current Fuel Supplier 
*Lead*: https://cs81.lightning.force.com/one/one.app#/sObject/00Q26000005C93FEAS/view
*Lead converted to Opp:* https://cs81.lightning.force.com/one/one.app#/sObject/00626000008NZBuAAO/view

For *4th* Point user is getting same error. 

The error - “_If Current Supplier = LPG please complete all fields in the section labelled Competitor Information._” is not covering the fields *“Potential Tonnage and Number of Delivery Points”* and there is no separate error for these fields.

*7.* User should be able to *create* a lead (when the Current Fuel Supplier is set to LPG)
*without* providing all the below fields.
- Potential Tonnage 
- No of Delivery Points 
- Competitor LPG Supplier 
- Contractual Status (Current contract) 
- Competitor Contract End Date 
- Size of cylinder they use 
- Current price 

Currently, above fields are required(when Fuel Supplier is set to LPG) while *CREATING* the lead. As per US, they should be required while *CONVERTING* the lead.


*5th* Point is failing. The validation should be bypassed when Current Fuel Supply = LPG and ""Does Not Wish To Disclose"" is set to True.

[~mayur.vats] FYI!","15/Jan/18 4:28 PM;stephanie.stylianou;[~kunal.narula]
1st point: you are right. we missed a validation rule. The validation rule has now been created
4th Point : this must have been a deployment issue -  I completed destructive changes to a ""duplicate"" validation rule (same name but with erroneous behaviour) and it was there again for some reason CC [~alexey.ovriakh]: can you please check why this was redeployed? We need to ensure this does not keep happening otherwise it will keep failing
7th Point: See above
5th pont: See above

Moving this to CI for Pull request acceptance
","16/Jan/18 3:19 PM;kunal.narula;Thanks [~stephanie.stylianou] for fixing all these issues. This is ready for Client Acceptance.

The validation is working fine.

As for changing the status of the lead when the user has a sales profile in the discovery sandbox. Yes there seems to be an issue which is failing to trigger a flow. The IC sandbox is working fine though. 

[~jayna.halai] can you try to take a look?
","12/Feb/18 12:02 PM;stephanie.stylianou;[~kunal.narula]

Issue occurring due to CG-743 that prevents change of ownership

The validation rule needs to be REMOVED from the sandbox. It should not have been created . Issue on  CG-743 due to Organisational Wide defaults allowing transfer access, this has been changed in Discovery

This should now be resolved.

[~mayur.vats] - ""Create and Customize Reports"" permission should not be checked. - This is not what confluence said on this profile - it said checked

The other 2 profiles confluence pages were updated to say the same since reports will be a requirement for everyone in the system to ensure the business roles can be met. 

Rest of permissions fixed. userpermissions were missing from the src xml so were manually added in. should be fine when deployed
",27/Feb/18 9:45 AM;alexey.ovriakh;[~mayur.vats] this is now in QA (Discovery) - might take 15 mins to arrive,"09/Mar/18 7:27 AM;mayur.vats;[~stephanie.stylianou] I have verified this in QA earlier but found these issues in regression testing today. Probably a miss from my side during bug retesting. These are the issues pending with Sales User profile.

For Sales User Profile

""Customize Application"" permission should be unchecked
""Manage Custom Permissions"" should be unchecked
""Manage Salesforce CRM Content"" should be unchecked

All these permissions are checked right now in discovery org for Sales profile but as per confluence link these permissions should not be checked.

Following our conversation, these are the details regarding delivery instructions.

 There are two original delivery instruction fields DEL01 and DEL02 that are held on the F03012, these are both capped at 30 characters each and will print on manual tickets and be visible on OBTC for the driver.

 There are two new fields that have been created for the OBTC project, these will only be visible on the OBTC and will not print on manual tickets. These two new fields are 55DL1 and 55DL2 and they each have a 127 character limit. These are held in the F55R200T (Distribution Details tag file) and the F55R201T (Sales order tag file).

 When we discussed this with the OBTC project team we came to the conclusion that we would need to mirror these four fields within Salesforce.  We believe they need to be available on the mobile app to allow Sales to add instructions as required when signing up new customers and also the desktop version to allow for the Customer Support Agents to revise these.","13/Feb/18 9:25 AM;stephanie.stylianou;[~Jenni.Street] : do we have more user friendly names?

Also, hav e these fields been discussed with [~mehdi.rahman]?",13/Feb/18 9:34 AM;Jenni.Street;[~stephanie.stylianou] we do - I am just thinking this through now and will agree with Jane at 11am.,"13/Feb/18 4:15 PM;stephanie.stylianou;[~Jenni.Street] any feedback on this?
","13/Feb/18 8:28 PM;Jenni.Street;Discussed with Hayley and have added in the two 30 character fields that are the as is fields (DEL01 and DEL02 that are held on the F03012) to avoid a dependency with the OBTC project. Discussed with [~stephanie.stylianou] and confirmed that a character limit increase was a change with minimal effort as when new OBTC goes live we may need to increase to 127 characters.

There is a chance upon go-live of OBTC we may need two additional fields: 55DL1 and 55DL2 and they are held in the F55R200T (Distribution Details tag file) and the F55R201T (Sales order tag file).  Further investigation required by the OBTC team to understand the impact of the 4 fields as the two original fields may only be required for Retailer Agreement type customers which we could look to dynamically populate in phase 2.

Issue is appearing in Discovery and SIT both.
cc:[~mayur.vats]","28/May/18 4:35 PM;jack.holliday;[~yogesh.garg] what are your replication steps please? 

Also, the process builder fires when today is greater than the contract end date and the status of the contract is expired then in stamps the expiration date on the related contracted prices with contract end date. 

I have just tested in Discovery: https://calor-gb--discovery.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/SBQQ__ContractedPrice__c/a0P5E000006aFRaUAM/view

Works as expected. Use the dates of the related contract record for the test in SIT. 

1. Update Contract Start Date to 27/05/2016 and Subscription Term: 24 
2. Expire Contract - change status to contract expired

Expected Outcome: Related contracted prices to have stamped the expiration date using the related contract's expiration date.

When a user change the stage of Lead *second* time below error occurs:

The record couldn’t be saved because it failed to trigger a flow. A flow trigger failed to execute the flow with version ID 3015E000000BZk5.

All the functionalities related to assignment of leads to different queues are working separately but when status of lead is changed multiple times, the queue assignment fails.

Steps to recreate the failed scenario:

1. Create a new lead by providing all mandatory fields.
2. Change the Status of lead from Open-Not Contacted --> Working-Contacted --> Marketing-Qualified
3. Now the Lead should be assigned to Qualification Team Queue.
4. Change the status of lead to Closed-Not Converted. This step will fail and below error will be displayed:

Flow error messages: <b>An unhandled fault has occurred in this flow</b> An unhandled fault has occurred while processing the flow. Please contact your system administrator for more information. Contact your administrator for help.

Ideally the lead should be assigned to Archiving Queue.

Another scenario:
1. Try changing the state of lead direct to _Closed-Not Converted_ and then to _Marketing-Qualified_. Trigger error will be displayed.

","15/May/18 4:05 PM;mayur.vats;Hi [~danyial.gilani] I have some queries on this story:

1. How will Email, Phone, Post Consent fields will be updated in Pardot (Both Original and Updated one). I am testing this manually right now.
2. Once I populated this fields manually and sync the record with CRM, these fields are not updated in Salesforce
3. Once these fields will be populated in Salesforce then only I can verify if the Expiration dates are populated correctly
along with the reason for Expiration for these fields.

cc: [~lino.diazalonso] [~priya.bhutani] [~abbas.mir]",29/May/18 9:43 AM;ricky.mortimer;[~leon.short] [~danyial.gilani] \- Can we urgently get an update on this.,"29/May/18 11:26 AM;removed61;[~mayur.vats] the website test form (tmp5) has not been configured to support this functionality as I mentioned during the handover of this US. We have 6 automation rules running to update the initial date fields if a form handler is completed and there has been a phone/post/email marketing consent opt in. You can find the automation rules here:

https://makepositive.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CGS/pages/487719088/Automation+Rules

You will be able to test these by submitting a form (tmp5) and then ensuring the fields are checked/opted in. The automation rules will trigger accordingly and sync with Salesforce. The synchronisation behaviour is set to ""most updated record"" 


[~leon.short] [~ricky.mortimer]","30/May/18 7:56 AM;mayur.vats;[~danyial.gilani] I remember the discussion and I will try to explain the scenario that i have tried here. Please correct me if I am wrong:

1. I have created a prospect from the tmp5 form. Prospect got created as shown below:

 !Email Consent Fields Populated.png|thumbnail! 

2. After that my expectation was that the latest consent fields will be populated in salesforce lead record once data is synced from  Pardot to Salesforce. But fields do not populate as expected in salesforce.

 !Email Latest Consent not populated.png|thumbnail! 


Please let me know if my assumption regarding the flow is incorrect.

cc: [~ricky.mortimer] [~leon.short] [~abbas.mir]","30/May/18 9:45 AM;removed61;[~mayur.vats] Hi Mayur, this sync issue is something ongoing between the Pardot and SF instances. I will raise another case about sync issues with Pardot. 

cc: [~abbas.mir] [~leon.short] [~ricky.mortimer]","30/May/18 9:51 AM;removed61;Pardot Support case raised. Case Number: 19149823

I have made some changes to the pardot mapping fields for Prospect which seems to have resolved the issue, pending further tests from [~mayur.vats]. 

The issue was duplicate fields in Discovery causing confusion. For example:

{code:xml}
PostLatestConsent__c and Post_Latest_Consent__c
{code}

{Post_Latest_Consent__c } was a field created in Discovery by Leon. And then {PostLatestConsent__c} was created in IC 
and deployed as part of CI - hence the duplicates and confusion on mappings in Pardot. 

The redundant fields will need to be removed from Discovery. We can catch up on this when you are free. 
","01/Jun/18 4:27 PM;removed61;Hi [~mayur.vats], the fields in Pardot are now mapped to the fields that are used in the process builder in SF that Lino built. I am not sure why duplicate fields were created! This is now ready for testing.

cc: [~abbas.mir] [~leon.short] [~ricky.mortimer] ","01/Jun/18 4:59 PM;jack.holliday;[~danyial.gilani] Could you clean up Discovery and delete the redundant field?  Seems to be the following created by Leon..

* Email_Consent_Expiration_Date__c
* Email_Consent_Expiration_Reason__c
* Email_Latest_Consent__c
* Phone_Consent_Expiration_Date__c
* Phone_Consent_Expiration_Reason__c
* Phone_Latest_Consent__c
* Post_Consent_Expiration_Date__c
* Post_Consent_Expiration_Reason__c
* Post_Latest_Consent__c

cc: [~abbas.mir] [~vincent.spehner]",01/Jun/18 6:40 PM;leon.short;I'll delete these [~jack.holliday] - Another prime example of why I should leave core to the experts... :-),"01/Jun/18 7:26 PM;leon.short;These are gone now.
